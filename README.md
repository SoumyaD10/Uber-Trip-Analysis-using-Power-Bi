# Uber-Trip-Analysis-using-Power-Bi
This is a data analysis project accomplished by using Power Bi and uses data from a time period of 30 days covering multiple cities and in different time lines.

Some of the key highlights are:

i. By using City tab change of cities occurs that renders all the other tabs accordingly such as you can observe change in amount paid, booking timgs, vehicle used.

ii. By using the calender tab you can shorten or lengthen the time gaps of the calender.
