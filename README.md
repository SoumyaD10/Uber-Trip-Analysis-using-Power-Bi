# Uber-Trip-Analysis-using-Power-Bi
This is a data analysis project accomplished by using Power Bi and uses data from a time period of 30 days covering multiple cities and in different time lines.

Some of the key highlights are:

ii. By using the calender tab you can shorten or lengthen the time gaps of the calender.
